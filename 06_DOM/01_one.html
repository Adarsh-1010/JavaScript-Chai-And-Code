<!-- Que: What is DOM? -->
<!-- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document (such as an HTML or XML document) as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document (like an element, attribute, or text content). -->
