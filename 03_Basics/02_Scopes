// console.log(b);//Throws error b is not defined
console.log(c);//If any programmer has declared a variable c=300 but the output he is getting is 30 that is why var is not much preferred over let

let x=300; //This x is globally available anywhere in the below code
if(true){
    let x=30 //This variable is different from variable defined above if statement because it is having different scoping which is called block scoping....
    console.log("In block :",x);
}
console.log(x); //300

// Important Note => Global scoping is different in browser as compared to the node environment
